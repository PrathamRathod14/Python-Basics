- **14_exceptions.py**: Introduction to handling errors and exceptions in Python using `try` and `except`. ⚠️

### 2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** 🧑‍💻
Once you are comfortable with the basics, this section introduces you to object-oriented programming principles.

- **15_classes_objects.py**: Learn about classes and objects in Python, and how to organize code using OOP. 🏷️
- **16_inheritance.py**: Understand inheritance, where a class can inherit properties and methods from another class. 🔄
- **17_polymorphism.py**: Learn about polymorphism and how objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common base class. 🔀
- **18_modules.py**: Explore Python modules and how to import and organize code across different files. 🗂️
- **19_opp_advanced.py**: Dive deeper into advanced OOP concepts like method overriding, class methods, and static methods. 🏅

### 3. **Functional Programming** 🔧
In this section, you'll learn about functional programming features in Python, which allow for more concise and powerful code.

- **20_lambda_functions.py**: Introduction to lambda functions, which are anonymous and concise functions. 🧩
- **21_map_filter.py**: Learn about the `map()` and `filter()` functions to apply operations on iterables. 🔄
- **22_decorators.py**: Understand decorators, a powerful tool for modifying the behavior of functions or methods. 🎨
- **23_generators.py**: Learn how to create generators, which allow for lazy evaluation and efficient iteration over large data sets. 🎢
- **24_comprehensions.py**: Introduction to list, dictionary, and set comprehensions for concise and efficient data manipulation. 🔍

### 4. **Concurrency & Multithreading** ⏱️
This advanced section dives into concurrency, multithreading, and multiprocessing concepts, essential for improving the performance of programs with I/O-bound or CPU-bound tasks.

- **25_json_handling.py**: Learn how to work with JSON data, a common format for exchanging information between systems. 🧩
- **26_datetime.py**: Understand how to work with dates and times in Python using the `datetime` module. 🕒
- **27_sqlite_database.py**: Introduction to SQLite, a lightweight database solution for embedding into Python applications. 💾
- **28_logging.py**: Learn how to log events in your programs, which helps with debugging and monitoring. 📝
- **29_regex.py**: Understand how to use regular expressions to find and manipulate text data. 🔍
- **30_requests_api.py**: Learn how to interact with APIs over HTTP using the `requests` library. 🌐
- **31_libraries.py**: Explore other commonly used Python libraries and tools for various tasks. 📚
- **32_web_scraping.py**: Introduction to web scraping, gathering data from web pages programmatically. 🌍
- **33_multiprocessing.py**: Learn about multiprocessing for parallel processing of tasks to utilize multiple CPU cores. ⚡
- **34_multithreading.py**: Explore multithreading for managing concurrent tasks and I/O-bound operations. 🔄
- **35_threading.py**: Understand Python's `threading` module and how to handle threads for running multiple tasks in parallel. 🧵
